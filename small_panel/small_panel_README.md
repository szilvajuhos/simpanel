# Small simulated panel for testing

This directory contains a small panel with 3 regions, each region is about 10K bps long. The files are:

- normal FASTQs: small\_panel\_37\_N\_R1.fastq.gz  small\_panel\_37\_N\_R2.fastq.gz 
- tumour FASTQs: small\_panel\_37\_T\_R1.fastq.gz  small\_panel\_37\_T\_R2.fastq.gz 
- normal BAM: normal.bam  normal.bam.bai
- tumour BAM: tumour.bam tumour.bam.bai
- etalon germline calls: small\_germline.vcf
- etalon somatic calls: small\_somatic.vcf 
- BED of regions: small\_panel\_hg19.bed 


Note the somatic calls are really for testing, has no biological meanings.
